# DataPhilly Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

DataPhilly is dedicated to providing a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of personal characteristics or background.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all official DataPhilly events, spaces, and communications, including talks, workshops, social events, online forums, and official social media channels. It does not apply to participants' personal lives or activities outside of DataPhilly contexts.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all participants, including attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and organizers, to:

- Treat others with respect and kindness
- Communicate openly and considerately
- Be mindful of your surroundings and fellow participants
- Respect the venue and the property of others
- Follow the directions of event organizers

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment or intimidation in any form
- Discrimination or exclusionary behavior
- Disruptive behavior during presentations or events
- Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention
- Offensive comments or jokes
- Invasion of privacy, including taking photos or recordings without consent
- Theft or attempted theft
- Violation of the host venue's policies

## Addressing Unacceptable Behavior

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, event organizers will take the following steps:

1. For minor issues: Politely ask the participant to stop the behavior. Most issues can be resolved with a respectful request.

2. For persistent or serious issues: Ask the participant to leave the event. If they refuse, seek assistance from venue security or other event organizers.

3. For any behavior that threatens safety or violates the law: Contact local law enforcement immediately.

Event organizers should use their best judgment and prioritize the safety and positive experience of all participants. When in doubt, organizers are encouraged to consult with senior DataPhilly leadership.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to a DataPhilly organizer as soon as possible. All reports will be handled with discretion. Avoid public accusations or callouts before reporting through official channels.

## Application to Leadership

This Code of Conduct applies equally to all participants, including DataPhilly organizers and leadership. Reports of violations by leadership will be handled by an impartial party.

## Social Media and Public Statements

We encourage respectful discussion of ideas and technologies. However, please refrain from making public accusations or callouts related to Code of Conduct violations. Instead, report concerns through official channels.

(OPTIONAL) ## Photography and Recording

Please ask for explicit permission before taking photos or recordings of individuals or presentations. Respect the privacy and wishes of others.

(OPTIONAL) ## Intellectual Property

Respect the intellectual property rights of others. Do not share or distribute content without the owner's permission.

## Interpretation and Amendments

DataPhilly organizers have the right to interpret and amend this Code of Conduct. Any major changes will be communicated to the community for feedback before implementation.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact [insert contact information for DataPhilly organizers].

By participating in DataPhilly events, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. We appreciate your cooperation in maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment focused on the sharing of ideas and knowledge.

## Examples of Unacceptable Behavior and Recommended Actions

To help event organizers respond consistently and appropriately, here are examples of unacceptable behavior and recommended steps:

1. Inappropriate comments:
   Example: An attendee makes offensive remarks during a conversation.
   Action: Politely ask the attendee to refrain from such comments. If they persist, ask them to leave the event.

2. Disruptive behavior during presentations:
   Example: An audience member repeatedly interrupts a speaker or reacts strongly to potentially controversial content.
   Action: First, remind the individual of the event's guidelines for respectful discourse. If disruption continues, ask them to step outside with an organizer for a discussion. Emphasize that while diverse viewpoints are valued, the focus should be on constructive, professional dialogue. If behavior persists, ask them to leave the event.

3. Unwanted physical contact:
   Example: An attendee repeatedly touches another person despite being asked to stop.
   Action: Intervene immediately. Ask the offending individual to leave the event. Offer support to the affected person.

4. Harassment via event channels:
   Example: A participant sends unwelcome, inappropriate messages to another attendee through the event's platform.
   Action: Issue a warning to the offender. If behavior continues, remove their access to the event platform and future events.

5. Theft or property damage:
   Example: An attendee is caught attempting to steal from the venue or another participant.
   Action: Immediately ask the individual to leave. Contact venue security and, if necessary, local law enforcement. Document the incident thoroughly.

6. Privacy violations:
   Example: Someone is taking photos of attendees or slides without permission.
   Action: Ask them to stop and delete any unauthorized photos. If they refuse, ask them to leave the event.

7. Alcohol-related misconduct:
   Example: An attendee becomes visibly intoxicated and belligerent at a social event.
   Action: Ensure they have safe transportation home, and ask them to leave the event if disruptive behavior continues.

Remember, the safety and comfort of all participants is the top priority. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and consult with other organizers or DataPhilly leadership.
