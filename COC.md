## I. Code of Conduct

### Our Commitment

DataPhilly is dedicated to providing a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of personal characteristics or background.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all official DataPhilly events, spaces, and communications, including talks, workshops, social events, online forums, and official social media channels. It applies equally to all participants, including attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, organizers, and leadership. It also covers event-related communications on social media and other online platforms.

This Code does not apply to participants' personal lives or activities outside of DataPhilly contexts.

### Expected Behavior

We expect all participants to:

- Treat others with respect and kindness
- Communicate openly and considerately
- Be mindful of your surroundings and fellow participants
- Respect the venue, its property, and the property of others
- Use event resources (including food and beverages) responsibly
- Clean up after yourself and dispose of waste properly
- Follow the directions of event organizers and venue-specific guidelines
- Consume alcohol responsibly if provided at events

All participants should behave in accordance with professional standards, adhering to both this Code of Conduct and their employer's policies on appropriate workplace behavior.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Disruptive behavior during presentations or events
- Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention
- Offensive comments or jokes
- Theft, attempted theft, or property damage
- Misuse of event resources or disregard for venue policies

Repeated violations or engaging in unacceptable behaviors may result in being asked to leave the event or being barred from future events.

## II. Enforcement and Reporting

### Addressing Unacceptable Behavior

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, event organizers will:

1. For minor issues: Ask the participant to stop the behavior.
2. For persistent or serious issues: Ask the participant to leave the event, seeking assistance from venue security if necessary.
3. For safety threats or law violations: Contact local law enforcement.

Consequences may range from a warning to expulsion from the event without refund, depending on the severity. Repeated violations or severe misconduct may result in being barred from future DataPhilly events.

DataPhilly is committed to enforcing this Code of Conduct fairly and consistently.

### Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to a DataPhilly organizer promptly. All reports will be handled discreetly. Avoid public accusations before reporting through official channels.

For concerns about a potential attendee prior to an event, please contact [insert appropriate contact information].

### Incident Response

DataPhilly organizers will respond promptly to all reported violations. We will take appropriate action to address the situation and prioritize attendee safety and well-being. This may include asking the offending party to leave, ending the event early if necessary, or contacting venue security or authorities in severe cases.

### Application to Leadership

This Code of Conduct applies equally to all participants, including DataPhilly organizers and leadership. Violations by leadership will be handled by an impartial party.

## III. Event Policies

### Social Media and Public Statements

We encourage respectful discussion of ideas and technologies. Please refrain from making public accusations related to Code of Conduct violations. Instead, report concerns through official channels.

### Photography, Recording, and Content Distribution

Some events may be photographed, streamed online, or recorded for public distribution. Speakers should not include confidential or proprietary information in their presentations.

## IV. Contact Information

For questions or concerns, please contact [insert contact information for DataPhilly organizers].

By participating in DataPhilly events, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. We appreciate your cooperation in maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment.

## V. Examples and Additional Information

## Examples of Unacceptable Behavior and Recommended Actions

To help event organizers respond consistently and appropriately, here are examples of unacceptable behavior and recommended steps:

1. Inappropriate comments:
   Example: An attendee makes an offensive remark or inappropriate joke with sexual connotations.
   Action: Politely inform the attendee that their comment is inappropriate and ask them to refrain from such remarks. Explain the impact of their words if necessary. If they persist after being warned, ask them to leave the event.

2. Disruptive behavior during presentations:
   Example: An audience member repeatedly interrupts a speaker or reacts strongly to potentially controversial content.
   Action: First, remind the individual of the event's guidelines for respectful discourse. If disruption continues, ask them to step outside with an organizer for a discussion. Emphasize that while diverse viewpoints are valued, the focus should be on constructive, professional dialogue. If behavior persists, ask them to leave the event.

3. Unwanted physical contact:
   Example: An attendee repeatedly touches another person despite being asked to stop.
   Action: Intervene immediately. Ask the offending individual to leave the event. Offer support to the affected person.

4. Harassment via event channels:
   Example: A participant sends unwelcome, inappropriate messages to another attendee through the event's platform.
   Action: Issue a warning to the offender. If behavior continues, remove their access to the event platform and future events.

5. Theft or property damage:
   Example: An attendee is caught attempting to steal from the venue or another participant.
   Action: Immediately ask the individual to leave. Contact venue security and, if necessary, local law enforcement. Document the incident thoroughly.

6. Disrespect for venue or misuse of event resources:
   Example: An attendee is repeatedly taking excessive amounts of food or damaging venue property.
   Action: Politely remind the individual of the expectations for respecting the venue and event resources. If the behavior continues, ask them to leave the event and consider barring them from future events.

7. Alcohol-related misconduct:
   Example: An attendee becomes visibly intoxicated and belligerent at a social event.
   Action: Ensure they have safe transportation home, and ask them to leave the event if disruptive behavior continues.

Remember, the safety and comfort of all participants is the top priority. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and consult with other organizers or DataPhilly leadership.

### Important Note

This Code of Conduct is a guideline, not a legal document. It doesn't create any contractual relationships. DataPhilly is not responsible for the actions of individual participants or event sponsors. By attending our events, you consent to photography, recording, and content distribution as described above. We maintain confidentiality of reported incidents to the extent possible. Retaliation against those who report violations is prohibited. DataPhilly reserves the right to remove any participant from our events or online spaces at our discretion.
