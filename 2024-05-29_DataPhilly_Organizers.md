Additionally, they reviewed the current backlog of tasks and assigned responsibilities to team members.

## Key Points
1. **Open Collective Sponsorship Funds**:
   - The team needs to decide whether to spend down the current funds or find a new fiscal sponsor by September 30th.
   - The consensus was to opt for spending down the funds for now, as it provides more flexibility and requires less upfront work.
   - The team will explore partnering with Code for Philly to find a suitable fiscal sponsor in the future.

2. **Event and Sponsor Backlog**:
   - The team has been maintaining an event and sponsor backlog on the Organizers' Canvas page.
   - Mark and Miguel have been primarily responsible for updating and managing this backlog.
   - The backlog is considered complete for now, and the task will be moved to the "Done" column.
   - Potential sponsors for upcoming events include Motion Recruiting and Vanguard. Tatiana is actively looking for a sponsor for the July social event.

3. **Task Assignment and Collaboration**:
   - The team reviewed the backlog of tasks and assigned responsibilities to various organizers.
   - Some key assignments include:
     - Tatiana and Miguel: Develop new member engagement plans
     - Michael: Investigate alternative fiscal sponsors and acquire recording equipment
     - Mark: Expand partnerships with universities and local conferences
   - The team emphasized the importance of collaboration and encouraged organizers to seek assistance from others when needed.

4. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - The team discussed the importance of collecting and analyzing data from past events to inform future planning.
   - Tatiana and Miguel will work on organizing event data in a tabular format, including host information, participant details, and survey results.
   - The data will be used to identify popular event topics, locations, and formats to guide future event planning.

5. **University Partnerships**:
   - Mark discussed his efforts to reach out to professors at Villanova University and his plans to contact other universities like UPenn, Drexel, and Temple to establish annual events.
   - These partnerships aim to create a strong connection between DataPhilly and local universities, providing opportunities for students and faculty to engage with the data science community.

## Action Items
1. Michael to communicate the decision to spend down the Open Collective funds to the platform by the end of June.
2. Tatiana and Miguel to collaborate on developing new member engagement plans.
3. Michael to investigate alternative fiscal sponsors and acquire recording equipment.
